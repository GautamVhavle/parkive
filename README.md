# PROJECT PARKIVE

---
## DESCRIPTION

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project is a smart parking system designed to help drivers
easily find available parking spots. The system uses ultrasonic
sensors and Node MCU ESP32 to detect the presence of a car in a 
parking spot and send the data to a server. The server then 
visualizes the data and provides information on the parking 
spot's status, including whether it is occupied or vacant.

The system also includes a backend database that can be used for 
data science models to track parking usage patterns and optimize 
parking allocation. This project is ideal for anyone interested 
in IoT, data science, and smart city technologies.

### Features:

- Ultrasonic sensors for accurate detection of parking spots
- Node MCU ESP32 for wireless communication
- Server-side visualization of parking data
- Backend database for data science models
